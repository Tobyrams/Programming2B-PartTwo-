# Programming2B-PartTwo- Student Module Manager
This Project builds from part one. Part 2 is about adding a SQL database so that the info gets stored and not wiped after reopeing the application. 
The user should be able to register and login in into the application, and should only be able to view thier own info/Modules. These new features will be implemented
with the help of ADO.NET/Enitiy Framework Core.

## Features
- **SQL** The info shall persist in the database.
- **User registration** a new user will be able to register and login in with a new account.
- **Data filtering** user will not be able to see another users info, only info of current user is displayed.
- **Multi-threading** when user goes from one page to another, a loading page will be triggered to allow the information to properly load.
